                <h1>Season 21: Battle of the Hosts</h1>

<p>Season 21: Battle of the Hosts is the first in the club’s history to have co-hosts, Ty Nachenberg and Madeline Arcaro, and each has a tribe. The iconography for the season is heavily inspired by chess, as the “theme” for the season is a chess match between Ty and Madeline’s tribe. Despite this, Ty and Madeline did not make any tangible impacts on the game or the players that would give any advantage to their tribe, or disadvantage to the other tribe.</p>

<p>The season started August 27th. The players were split into tribes that Ty and Madeline drafted the night before, unbeknownst to them.</p>

<p>Ty’s tribe decided on the name Kingpins, keeping with the chess theme. Madeline’s tribe, also in keeping with the theme, chose the name Passant, in reference to the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant target=_blank>en passant</a> capture in chess.</p>

                    <h1>The Rundown</h1>
                    <h2>Pre-Merge</h2>
                    <p>Kingpins lost the first challenge, a relay race where each stage of the race was a different challenge, a puzzle, a race where your hands and legs are tied etc. This sent them to tribal council, where Trevor was voted out unanimously. Trevor voted for Shayne, who some players didn't trust, and wanted to go home instead, but Shayne had made relationships with enough of the tribe to keep her in the game for the first week.</p>

<p>The next challenge was the hostage challenge, where one member of each tribe was hidden behind the school of public health on north campus. The rest of the tribe was at McKeldin Mall, where they were able to ask five yes-or-no questions every ten minutes to try to find their teammate. In the meantime, the remaining players split into groups of three to fan out and look for their missing tribe member.</p>

<p>Passant was crushed, in part because Yahya wasn’t sure what constituted north and south campus, so when asked if he was on North Campus, his confused sounding yes made the tribe look closer to the center of campus. That week Julia was voted out unanimously for similar reasons to Trevor: a general lack of strong connections, other than with Evan and Ethan B, who were both on the bottom of the tribe. </p>

<p>The next three weeks followed similar paths to the weeks previous. Players who were unable to make strong connections with the majority of the tribe were voted out, and challenges went back and forth between Kingpins and Passant. After the hostage challenge, the next three people voted out were Evan from Passant, Casey from Kingpins and Ethan B from Passant. Interestingly, of the five players who had interacted with the survivor club before the season started, wither having been on the crew in a previous season, or having played in a “mini” (a one day survivor game where challenges and tribals happen every 20 minutes or so) that the club hosted, four of them were out in the first five votes.</p>

<p>Evan and Ethan both played in the survivor mini that took place in Spring, 2023, and Casey and Trevor were both members of crew before they played. The fifth member of that group, Chase, at this point was in a very good position with a core four alliance with Malik, Mel and Lauren S that they called the “all guys” alliance, with Ali, Emma and Yahya as solid allies, but squarely outside the four.</p>

<p>On Kingpins, the vibes were pretty good. Jack, Mimi, Matt, Shayne, Sara and Lauren K were a group of six that was really three groups of two, with Mimi and Matt, Shayne and Jack and Sara and Lauren K working in tandem. Ethan O and Lydia were on the outs, not having lots of free time to spend on Survivor, and thereby never really having the relationships they needed to make a deep run into the game.</p>


<p>With 15 players left, the players were told that they needed to pick a leader. Each tribe elected one, and Ethan O and Yahya were chosen. The players were then informed that they would be switching tribes, and that Ethan and Yahya would each draft a tribe.</p>

<p>Each captain chose four players, all from their original tribes. Ethan’s tribe consisted of Mimi, Matt, Shayne and Jack, and Yahya chose the “all guys” alliance, Chase, Malik, Lauren S and Mel. The captains were then stopped and informed that the five remaining unpicked players: Emma, Lydia, Ali, Sara and Lauren K would become their third tribe. They named themselves Yoni, after the hindu word generally agreed to mean vulva or vagina, a joke referencing the fact that the tribe was entirely women.</p>

<p>The next challenge, Taskmaster, had a list of 150 tasks that tribes needed to complete, varying from embarrassing themselves on campus, writing long essays about survivor or licking peanut butter off of their tribemate’s fist. Whichever tribe could complete the most tasks in 48 hours would win, but most importantly, whichever tribe completed the least amount of tasks would be sent to tribal council. The new Kingpins tribe lost, and Ethan O volunteered to be sent home, knowing that he was on the outs and that he didn’t have the passion for the game that the rest of his tribe did.</p>

<p>Taskmaster brought the tribes closer together on the whole, as doing a list of embarrassing things with people who all have the same niche interest would. It meant that after the challenge at final 14, where players did a dizzy bat then tried to throw things into a bucket, it would be more difficult to vote someone out. Unfortunately for the players, two tribes would be going to tribal council at final 14. Kingpins won the challenge, meaning that after the vote, each tribe would have four remaining members.</p>

<p>On Passant, Yahya was voted out unanimously. He was unaware that he had drafted a four person alliance onto a five person tribe with him, and while the players wanted to keep Yahya around for vibes and as a number down the line, somebody had to go.</p>

<p>On Yoni, the three former Kingpins aligned to vote out Emma, who they saw as a bigger threat than Ali. Sara and Lauren K heavily considered keeping Emma and Ali, both of whom they liked, and voting out Lydia, who they knew less, even having been on a tribe with her since the beginning of the game. Ultimately, they decided that holding tribal lines was most important, and voted out Emma, whose hair was still dyed green and cut into bangs for two separate taskmaster tasks.</p>

<p>The final draft of the pre-merge, campus cross world, took place at Hornbake plaza, near the center of campus. Three players from each tribe were blindfolded, and one caller would guide them with their voice from the top of the Hornbake stairs towards arrows with names of buildings on campus on them. After all of the arrows were collected, blindfolded players had to put the arrows into slits cut into a post in a way that the arrows would point towards the building on the arrow. If Knight Hall was on an arrow, you would need that arrow to be pointing at Knight Hall. The only people who could see the names on the arrows were the callers, which caused confusion for the players, and caused the challenge to last for about a half hour.</p>

<p>Yoni finished last, and this time Sara and Lauren K decided it was time for Lydia to go. Ali played a hidden immunity idol that she found with Chase, but she didn’t need it, having only Lydia’s vote cast against her, with the three other girls voting for Lydia. That made Lydia the ninth player voted out of the game, and the last player voted out before the tribes merged.</p>

<h2>The Merge</h2>

<p>At the merge things seemed to be split down original tribe lines. Despite being one tribe, called the Pawn Stars, 2/3rds of the remaining players had only been with one group of people since the beginning of the game. That meant it looked like tribal lines would hold up for the first few votes, which was bad news for Passant, as they were outnumbered 6-5.</p> 

<p>But Sara and Lauren K, the Kingpins who had been sent to Yoni during the tribe swap, had other plans. Feeling that they were on the bottom of the current six, and threatened by Shayne, they devised a plan to vote out one of their own without getting blood on their hands.</p>

<p>Sara had an alliance with Chase, and knew that he had an immunity idol, so she and Lauren convinced the kingpins to vote for Chase, and told Chase that the Kingpins were coming after him. In return for the information, they wanted Chase and the other Passant members to vote out Shayne, because after Shayne was voted out Sara and Lauren would have stronger relationships with the rest of the Kingpins, and would have built significant social capital with Passant.</p>

<p>This put Lauren and Sara in a power position, the Kingpins didn’t know that they had been betrayed, and Passant felt like they had numbers moving forward. Both sides were wrong, and Lauren K and Sara played the middle again at final 10.</p>

<p>Ali and Malik won immunity from two different immunity challenges. The players were told that they would either have to outwit or outlast in a challenge, and they would choose one challenge to perform in. Everyone other than Jack, Sara and Malik chose outwit, and did a word puzzle, which Ali solved within five minutes. The other three did a UMD Survivor classic, “Poles” where players have to stand on the base of one of the lights in front of the Xfinity Center for as long as they can. In previous seasons, the challenge has lasted as long as four hours, but with only three players trying it in this season, it was over in 23 minutes. </p>

<p>Having two of the five Passant members immune meant that Lauren S, Chase and Mel had targets on their backs. Despite being tied 5-5, the original Passant understood that Sara and Lauren K weren’t going to just abandon their original allies, and that extra votes in the game could muddle things for them. Their goal was to vote out Matt, who was pretty checked out mentally at this point. He wasn’t a fan of Survivor the show, and had personal things going on outside of the game that were more important. Their pitch to the rest of the game was that Matt was well insulated within the Kingpins, and his reticence and general aloofness about things going on in the game was disrespectful to the people who still actually wanted to be there. </p>

<p>This pitch didn’t move the needle for the Kingpins, who originally wanted to vote out Chase, but Sara pitched hard to save him because of her alliance with him. She convinced the rest of the alliance that Chase’s target was so big, that him being in the game was beneficial for everyone else. The alliance decided on voting for Lauren S, who was a big social threat and strong player, albeit a bit under the radar. It also helped that she was not in anyone’s long-term plans, unlike the other option, Mel, who was making headway on a “good vibes alliance” the first inter-tribe alliance with her, Malik, Sara, Lauren K and Jack. </p>

<p>The votes were read, and it ended up being six votes for Lauren S, five for Matt and one for Chase. This was surprising because there were only 10 players left, and 12 votes. Lauren K had an extra vote from before the merge and used it on Lauren S, leaving her as the last Lauren standing, and Shayne had an advantage that gave him a one-time vote for someone after he was eliminated and he chose Chase. </p>

<p>This left Chase in a bad position. He was far and away the game’s biggest threat, and his alliance with Sara could only keep him around for so long. If he didn’t win immunity at final nine then he would’ve been voted out unanimously, as the game had reached a point where Chase was not in anyone’s long-term plans. But Chase was not done yet.</p> 

<p>He and Matt both won “Touchy Subjects” a challenge where players answer questions about other players (Who is playing the worst game, who is going to win, who is the biggest flirt, who is most likely to have their fake ID rejected etc.) and then guess who was the most popular choice. </p>

<p>Despite his win, Matt decided that it was time for him to leave the game, and gave immunity to his closest ally, Mimi, before asking to be voted out. He, Mimi and Jack all voted for Lauren at her request. She had an advantage that became more powerful the more votes she got at tribal council, and with three votes it became a steal-a-vote. She did not tell this to anyone not in on the plan though, and players were confused as to why Lauren got the votes, and who would have voted for her. </p>

<p>The next challenge had players face off 1v1. Each player had to balance a water bottle on a paddle. Cones were placed in a circle about 15 feet in diameter, and players had to knock their opponent’s water bottle to the ground before theirs was knocked off. Round one was single elimination, round two was best of three and the championship was best of five. </p>

<p>Jack and Chase squared off in the final, and Chase, playing for his life, took a 2-1 lead before Jack was able to clutch out the challenge (in front of his girlfriend) and steal immunity away from the person who needed it the most. </p>

<p>Chase’s and closest ally from the beginning of the game, Malik, were now at war. Both of them thought that the other had flipped on their duo, so each of them spent the week of final eight rallying troops to eliminate the other. Chase’s position in the game was untenable though, and he couldn’t find anyone to go to bat for him against Malik. He had given his closest remaining ally in the game, Sara, an immunity idol a week prior as a bargaining chip, but when she wouldn’t give it back, Chase realized his game was over.</p>

<p>Chase was voted out 7-1, the first unanimous vote of the merge.</p>

<p>The next week, Ali won immunity again. At this point, original tribal lines were blurry, the unanimous vote on Chase proved that people were willing to turn on people they’d played the entire game with to get them to the next day. And at this point, every realized the threat posed by Lauren and Sara. They had controlled each of the votes post-merge, and were the catalysts for most of the game approaching the merge by voting out Emma and then Lydia on Yoni. </p>

<p>Sara was unaware of this, and pitched that everyone vote for Jack because she felt that Jack was a big threat, and it was going to be hard to vote him out after a certain point. At this point though, Sara was having a hard time seeing the skin on her hands due to the obscene amount of blood on them, so she was planning on voting for Mimi. She wanted to have her cake and eat it too, and unfortunately for her you just can’t do that in Survivor. </p> 

<p>Malik, Mel and Ali had other plans. They thought of Sara as less of a threat than Lauren, her closest ally, because of Sara’s poor jury management and Lauren’s all-around cleaner gameplay. They also felt that Sara would work with them in the future against the remaining Kingpins, something they couldn’t guarantee with Lauren. </p>

<p>The kingpins, Lauren, Mimi and Jack felt like it was Sara that needed to go. Obviously they were closer with Lauren than with Sara, and their idea was that with Sara gone, they would be at final six in a three-on-three tie with Mimi’s immunity idol and Lauren’s steal-a-vote advantage that they could use to get rid of one of the Passant members, before picking the rest of them off with their numbers advantage. </p>

<p>Conversations continued throughout the week, and plans changed multiple times in the days leading up to tribal council, but when the votes were read, there were three for Lauren, three for Sara, and one vote for Mimi. Sara’s wasted vote meant that there would be a revote, only she and Lauren could receive votes and neither of them would vote. Everyone stuck to their guns in the revote, and because Lauren lost her vote in the revote, the final tally was 3-2, and Lauren was sent home with her steal-a-vote still in her pocket. </p>

<p>The next challenge was Knight Moves, based on the Big Brother challenge of the same name and fitting with the chess theme. Players start on a 9x9 grid and have to move two boxes in one direction and one box in another direction like a knight would in chess. Once you land on a square it’s out of play, and once you’re out of available moves you’re out of the challenge. </p>

<p>Ali won immunity for her fourth time, and it made the voting process for the week easy. Sara, after her disastrous voting the week prior, felt indebted to the people who saved her, and had no such feelings towards Jack and Mimi, who had tried to vote her out. They pitched to her that she vote out Malik with them to no avail. The team split the vote between Mimi and Jack, knowing that if Mimi played her idol Jack would go home and if she didn’t he would go home. She played her idol, sending her longest tenured ally out of the game at sixth place. </p>

<h2>FINALE</h2>

<p>In Survivor on TV, the finale episode is generally two hours and covers the last five people left in the game, so we’ll do that here as well. The five remaining players all brought something legitimate to the table as to why they should win. We will go alphabetically. </p>

<h5>Ali:</h5>
<p>Ali was a sophomore, one of only four who played, and the smallest person on the cast, and yet she won four individual immunity challenges going into the final five. Her electric personality, quick wit and infectious smile made people want to be around her, and she was the first person to get anyone to flip on their original tribe to save her. (Albeit she did play an idol at that tribal that she didn’t need). She made a series of smart game decisions and had a solid alliance with the people from Passant. Despite not being anyone’s true number one ally, she was always high up on people’s lists of people they trusted. </p>

<p>Ali’s path to the end was going to be tough, everyone recognized her as the biggest threat in the game despite being the game’s least threatening player in a fistfight, and she was going to have to win challenges or make others look more threatening than her to make it to final tribal council. </p>

<h5>Malik:</h5>
<p>Malik did a lot to just make it to the final five. He voted correctly at every tribal but one, and was a serious contributor to pretty much every vote that he attended. He had good relationships and made smart strategic decisions revolving around keeping his core Passant members in the game and not letting anyone stray too far from the reservation. He also got credit for voting out Chase and was a serious catalyst in voting out Lauren K, who at that point were two of the biggest threats of the season.</p>

<p>His smart social strategy and ability to keep people in a comfortable position until they weren’t of use to him anymore were his strong-suits, but playing the middle for the whole game is tough, could he keep that up until the end? And if he did, would the jury respect him for it?</p>

<h5>Mel:</h5>
<p>Mel’s gameplay was up to this point spotless. She had yet to be voted for, and was never even on the radar for anyone. She was able to hide behind the threat of Malik while using his social skills, as well as her own very very potent social skills to make players be okay with the possibility of working with her long-term. She and Malik were the closest allies in the game, and people felt better about working in a long-term relationship with Mel because they didn’t think of her as the kind of threat that Malik was, but because of that Mel was able to wield more power than Malik over the course of the season, despite Malik having more power week-to-week. 

<p>Mel’s endgame was simple: hope that when the dust settled, she was the most threatening player left in the game when it was time for final tribal council. Did she do enough dirty work to beat Malik? Did she do enough dirty work to beat anyone? It was hard to say. </p>

<h5>Mimi:</h5>
<p>Mimi’s impact on the game was ironclad. Despite not being in on plenty of the votes post-merge, a lot of the social interactions between people came down to one question: Are you with Mimi or against her? Mimi’s intensity and devotion to her Kingpins tribe meant that she was going to figure out how to get her and her people to the end no matter what, but coming into the final five she had lost her three closest allies in the last four votes. She had to transition from being in the power position to scrambling on the bottom, and her form of scrambling involved finding anyone she could and throwing them under the bus ahead of her with stories, rumors and good old-fashioned alliance building. </p>

<p>Did Mimi get into the scrambling business too late? Her story would be a good one if she could tell it to her many friends on the jury, but a lack of power-plays and a handful of incorrect votes could look bad if she had to argue against strong players at final tribal. She needed to make it two votes to find out, and even that looked like a tall order. </p>

<h5>Sara:</h5>
<p>Sara’s role in the story of the season was simple. She was the villain. A large portion of the jury felt she was directly responsible for them going home, and did not respect the way she played. She was too duplicitous, she cut too many throats, she said she was nice but has betrayed everyone close to her. But that also meant that she had the longest resume of the season. None of the votes up to that point in the merge (except Matt) would have been in that position had it not been for Sara, for better or for worse, and by being the catalyst for so many moves she did have a case to make to the jury. The question was, did the jury want to hear it? With an idol in her pocket and a strong alliance Sara’s place in the game was secure, but it would only take one person to decide that she was dangerous to vote her out and end her journey with nothing. </p>

<p>Is betrayal worth it? Was she just doing what she had to do to stay alive? Can the bad guys ever win?</p>

<p>At final five the challenge was an eating challenge. Players had to eat four courses, and whoever was the last person to finish their meal would be eliminated. The first course was peas and olives, which Sara straight up refused to eat, the next course was graham crackers and cheese sticks, which Mel was the last to scarf down, then Ali was eliminated until two people remained. </p>

<p>Malik and Mimi needed to eat a tin of sardines, and could use the olive juice from the olives to help wash it down. Despite both of them giving it everything they had, Mimi pulled out a crucial immunity win, and left Malik to vomit without immunity. </p>

<p>Mimi’s win meant that there was only one option for the vote. Ali, the challenge beast, was going to be voted out if she couldn’t find an immunity idol. The only one left in the game was Sara’s, which she gave to Malik in case Ali used a <a href=https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_is_Power_Advantage”  target=”_blank”> Knowledge is Power advantage</a>, an obscure advantage from CBS Survivor that did not exist in the game. </p>

<p>Malik played the idol, negating Ali’s single vote for him, and Ali was eliminated in fifth place. </p>

<p>Immediately afterwards, the contestants lined up for the final four immunity challenge, and were told that the winner of this challenge would win a guaranteed spot in the final three with a chance to pitch their case to the jury as to why they should win Survivor Maryland. </p>

<p>The challenge involved balancing a bottle on a platform with a PVC pipe attached to the bottom as a handle. Every 10 minutes the pipe would increase in length, and players would have to always have their hands at the bottom, making the pipe harder to balance. During the third transition, everyone fell out of the challenge except for Mel, meaning that she had locked in her spot at Final Tribal Council. </p>

<p>In the two days between the challenge and tribal, Malik, Sara and Mimi all had their names thrown out as potential targets. Malik and Sara decided that Mimi, with her guaranteed jury votes and strong connection with the jury, as well as strong gameplay, was the biggest threat to win the game if she made it to final three. Sara felt that Malik and Mel would split the Passant votes on the jury, and she could win by getting the rest of them, so her win condition was that Mimi be eliminated. Malik also realized that he was never going to get anyone to vote for Sara at final four, so it was him or Mimi.</p>

 <p>Mimi and Mel thought that Malik was the biggest threat to win, with his strong strategic game and control throughout most of the merge. Mel in particular would benefit greatly from Malik going home because it would differentiate her game totally from the other two finalists. She and Malik had made every move together, and regardless of how much she liked him as a person, Malik being on the jury was her best chance to win. </p>

<p>That opened up a problem. When there is a 2-2 tie at final four, the tiebreaker is a firemaking competition, and Mimi was a fire engineering major who grew up on a farm. She could make a fire pretty easily and destroy Malik. Mel felt like she had played the best game up to that point, and felt like that a firemaking win would be a big enough resume boost for either player to maybe win, especially Malik. </p>

<p>There was a discussion between Mel and Mimi to both vote for Sara, because it annoyed them that she wouldn’t vote for Malik, and it would make firemaking easier because Sara wasn’t preparing for it. Mimi ultimately did vote for Sara, banking on Mel agreeing and not giving Malik the opportunity to make fire, but Mel decided that she liked her odds against Malik and Sara at final three and voted Mimi out, 3-1, ending her game in fourth place. </p>

<p>At final tribal, eight jurors asked questions about the game, the strategies, and the players. The finalists gave their speeches, answered questions, and got peppered with bullets from angry jurors who wanted to know why they were voted out of the game. Malik and Mel highlighted their social strategy chops, and their control throughout the game, and Sara argued that she had the biggest impact on the game, despite her mistakes. When the dust settled, the vote came in 4-4-0, four votes for Mel, four votes for Malik and no votes for Sara. This hasn’t happened (as far as I know) in the history of Survivor Maryland, and has only happened once on CBS Survivor in 45 seasons. </p>

<p>The tiebreaker is that Sara, the finalist who was not a part of the tie, had to vote for the winner. She voted for Mel, making Mel Calabrese the 21st winner of Survivor Maryland, ending the 10 season streak of alternating man-woman winners (a woman won season 20) and putting an exclamation point on the end of a whirlwind season. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, the jury respected the power that Mel wielded throughout the game, the relationships she built and the clean manner with which she was able to execute her plans. Malik got recognition for his strong social and strategic games, but Mel’s superior work of keeping herself out of harm’s way was what made her worthy of being Season 21’s winner. </p>
