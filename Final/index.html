                <h1>Season 21: Battle of the Hosts</h1>

<p>Season 21: Battle of the Hosts is the first in the club’s history to have co-hosts, Ty Nachenberg and Madeline Arcaro, and each has a tribe. The iconography for the season is heavily inspired by chess, as the “theme” for the season is a chess match between Ty and Madeline’s tribe. Despite this, Ty and Madeline did not make any tangible impacts on the game or the players that would give any advantage to their tribe, or disadvantage to the other tribe.</p>

<p>The season started August 27th. The players were split into tribes that Ty and Madeline drafted the night before, unbeknownst to them.</p>

<p>Ty’s tribe decided on the name Kingpins, keeping with the chess theme. Madeline’s tribe, also in keeping with the theme, chose the name Passant, in reference to the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant target=_blank>en passant</a> capture in chess.</p>

                    <h1>The Rundown</h1>
                    <h3>Pre-Merge</h3>
                    <p>Kingpins lost the first challenge, a relay race where each stage of the race was a different challenge, a puzzle, a race where your hands and legs are tied etc. This sent them to tribal council, where Trevor was voted out unanimously. Trevor voted for Sara, who some players wanted to go home instead, but Sara had made relationships with enough of the tribe to keep her in the game for the first week.</p>

<p>The next challenge was the hostage challenge, where one member of each tribe was hidden behind the school of public health on north campus. The rest of the tribe was at McKeldin Mall, where they were able to ask five yes-or-no questions every ten minutes to try to find their teammate. In the meantime, the remaining players split into groups of three to fan out and look for their missing tribe member.</p>

<p>Passant was crushed, in part because Yahya wasn’t sure what constituted north and south campus, so when asked if he was on North Campus, his confused sounding yes made the tribe look closer to the center of campus. That week Julia was voted out unanimously for similar reasons to Trevor: a general lack of strong connections, other than with Evan and Ethan B, who were both on the bottom of the tribe. </p>

<p>The next three weeks followed similar paths to the weeks previous. Players who were unable to make strong connections with the majority of the tribe were voted out, and challenges went back and forth between Kingpins and Passant. After the hostage challenge, the next three people voted out were Evan from Passant, Casey from Kingpins and Ethan B from Passant. Interestingly, of the five players who had interacted with the survivor club before the season started, wither having been on the crew in a previous season, or having played in a “mini” (a one day survivor game where challenges and tribals happen every 20 minutes or so) that the club hosted, four of them were out in the first five votes.</p>

<p>Evan and Ethan both played in the survivor mini that took place in Spring, 2023, and Casey and Trevor were both members of crew before they played. The fifth member of that group, Chase, at this point was in a very good position with a core four alliance with Malik, Mel and Lauren S that they called the “all girls” alliance, with Ali, Emma and Yahya as solid allies, but squarely outside the four.</p>

<p>On Kingpins, the vibes were pretty good. Jack, Mimi, Matt, Shayne, Sara and Lauren K were a group of six that was really three groups of two, with Mimi and Matt, Shayne and Jack and Sara and Lauren K working in tandem. Ethan O and Lydia were on the outs, not having lots of free time to spend on Survivor, and thereby never really having the relationships they needed to make a deep run into the game.</p>


<p>With 15 players left, the players were told that they needed to pick a leader. Each tribe elected one, and Ethan O and Yahya were chosen. The players were then informed that they would be switching tribes, and that Ethan and Yahya would each draft a tribe.</p>

<p>Each captain chose four players, all from their original tribes. Ethan’s tribe consisted of Mimi, Matt, Shayne and Jack, and Yahya chose the “all girls” alliance, Chase, Malik, Lauren S and Mel. The captains were then stopped and informed that the five remaining unpicked players: Emma, Lydia, Ali, Sara and Lauren K would become their third tribe. They named themselves Yoni, after the hindu word generally agreed to mean vulva or vagina, a joke referencing the fact that the tribe was entirely women.</p>

<p>The next challenge, Taskmaster, had a list of 150 tasks that tribes needed to complete, varying from embarrassing themselves on campus, writing long essays about survivor or licking peanut butter off of their tribemate’s fist. Whichever tribe could complete the most tasks in 48 hours would win, but most importantly, whichever tribe completed the least amount of tasks would be sent to tribal council. The new Kingpins tribe lost, and Ethan O volunteered to be sent home, knowing that he was on the outs and that he didn’t have the passion for the game that the rest of his tribe did.</p>

<p>Taskmaster brought the tribes closer together on the whole, as doing a list of embarrassing things with people who all have the same niche interest would. It meant that after the challenge at final 14, where players did a dizzy bat then tried to throw things into a bucket, it would be more difficult to vote someone out. Unfortunately for the players, two tribes would be going to tribal council at final 14. Kingpins won the challenge, meaning that after the vote, each tribe would have four remaining members.</p>

<p>On Passant, Yahya was voted out unanimously. He was unaware that he had drafted a four person alliance onto a five person tribe with him, and while the players wanted to keep Yahya around for vibes and as a number down the line, somebody had to go.</p>

<p>On Yoni, the three former Kingpins aligned to vote out Emma, who they saw as a bigger threat than Ali. Sara and Lauren K heavily considered keeping Emma and Ali, both of whom they liked, and voting out Lydia, who they knew less, even having been on a tribe with her since the beginning of the game. Ultimately, they decided that holding tribal lines was most important, and voted out Emma, whose hair was still dyed green and cut into bangs for two separate taskmaster tasks.</p>

<p>The final draft of the pre-merge, campus cross world, took place at Hornbake plaza, near the center of campus. Three players from each tribe were blindfolded, and one caller would guide them with their voice from the top of the Hornbake stairs towards arrows with names of buildings on campus on them. After all of the arrows were collected, blindfolded players had to put the arrows into slits cut into a post in a way that the arrows would point towards the building on the arrow. If Knight Hall was on an arrow, you would need that arrow to be pointing at Knight Hall. The only people who could see the names on the arrows were the callers, which caused confusion for the players, and caused the challenge to last for about a half hour.</p>

<p>Yoni finished last, and this time Sara and Lauren K decided it was time for Lydia to go. Ali played a hidden immunity idol that she found with Chase, but she didn’t need it, having only Lydia’s vote cast against her, with the three other girls voting for Lydia. That made Lydia the ninth player voted out of the game, and the last player voted out before the tribes merged.</p>
