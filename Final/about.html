                    <h2>What is Survivor Maryland?</h2>

<p>Surviving college is hard. Between classes, work, relationships and learning what it is to be an adult, college students have to work hard to make it to graduation, or the end of the semester, or the end of the week. </p>

<p>But in 2013, University of Maryland Sophomore Austin Trupp had an idea to not just survive college, but to be a College Survivor. </p>

<p>He started a club he called “Survivor Maryland” at UMD, based on the popular reality show “Survivor” where 20 contestants live on an island and compete for a million dollar prize over 39 grueling days. </p>

<p>Obviously it isn’t feasible to make 20 UMD students live on an island, but every other part of the show is incorporated into the experience. Generally, 20 students start the semester in two “tribes” that compete in a challenge each week. The winning tribe is safe, but the losing tribe has to go to “Tribal Council” where each player will vote for one member of the team to eliminate from the game. Players meet throughout the week to build relationships with their fellow competitors and determine who to vote for. Whoever has the most votes cast against them is out, and the process repeats. </p>

<p>This continues until there are between 10 and 13 players left, when the tribes merge, and challenges become individual. At that point, only the player who wins the challenge is safe, and everyone goes to tribal council. Votes are cast, counted and announced, and the eliminated player joins “The Jury” a body of players who attend tribal councils until the end of the season, which generally ends right before finals week.</p>

<p>It continues like that until three players remain. Once there are three players left, the jury votes for a winner, using the information they got in the game, and at tribal councils. During the tribal council at final three, the final three players pitch their case as to why they should win the title of Sole Survivor, and a grand prize of whatever money is leftover in the club budget, usually about $100. </p>

<p>On top of the spectacle, the seasons are filmed, edited and put up on the <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN9B1MVCFcyc9lpD6UKOjtg target=_blank>Survivor Maryland YouTube Channel.</a> Players film themselves, and conversations between players, a “crew,” built up mostly of former and future players, film challenges and tribal councils and the hosts edit the seasons, but usually not for years after the season wraps. The players also have weekly videotaped “confessionals” with the hosts, where they lay out their plans, hopes, fears and goals for each vote. </p>

<p>10 years, 20 seasons, roughly 350 players and nine hosts later, Survivor Maryland is still going strong. Season 21 had between 75 and 80 applicants interviewed for 20 available player spots, and the hosts say that there are anywhere between 60 and 90 active club members in any given semester. </p>

<p>The players were chosen by the club’s executive board, a group of between 8 and 13 people who hold different positions in the club. Some executive jobs focus on gameplay, like the heads of challenges and twists who design challenges for the players. The head of twists hides advantages across campus and writes clues to those advantages that the players can win or find in challenges, among other things. </p>

<p>Some jobs focus more on the club itself, like the community and recruitment chairs, who plan parties, social events and help get the word out about the club. The club’s treasurer handles club finances, and the heads of production focus on getting good footage when filming, and corralling footage from players and crew members. </p>

<p>There are even mental health chairs, who check in weekly with players to make sure they’re handling the stress and pressure of an intense social and strategic game that’s on 24/7. </p>
