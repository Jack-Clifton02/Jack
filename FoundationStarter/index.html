			<p>Since there wasn’t a lesson this week because of the field trip being postponed, most of the work I did for this class in the past week has been preparing for next week’s quiz on weeds and staple crops from Maryland like wheat, barley and corn. Last week I was getting things like names and visual cues memorized, but this week I’ve been able to focus on the more niche aspects of each plant. For example, I can now pretty much differentiate between the types of seeds, and even the different subspecies of each weed, like how foxtail has multiple subspecies with different amounts of hair. I am confident going into Monday’s quiz, and even if there isn’t a quiz on Monday, I do feel like I have this wide breadth of base knowledge going forward, as I assume it’ll be useful down the line. </p>
