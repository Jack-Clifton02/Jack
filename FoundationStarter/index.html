                    <h1>The 40 Most Important Players and Coaches To The 2023/24 College Basketball Season</h1>
                    <p> We are officially 40 days away from tipping off the 2023-24 men's college basketball season.
<br><br>
With practices revving up this week, and conference media days and
preseason polls looming, it won't be long until the road to crowning a
champion in April begins.
<br><br>
The state of the sport is healthy and far from predictable. Just look at
the collection of teams at the Final Four this past year, with UConn
coming out with the title in Houston after outlasting San Diego State,
Florida Atlantic and Miami.
<br><br>
Name, image and likeness has made an impact and produced offseason bidding
wars for players. But if anything, college basketball's offseason chaos
has given the sport more storylines during downtimes on the calendar. And
the financial component for college athletes has led the reigning national
player of the year to elect to return to school in back-to-back seasons.
Before last year, when Kentucky star Oscar Tshiebwe returned to Lexington,
that had not occurred since Tyler Hansbrough did so in Chapel Hill in
2008.
<br><br>
The defending national player of the year heading into this season is
Purdue's Zach Edey, and he's a fitting candidate to kick off a new
preseason feature to our coverage this year: The FOX Sports College Hoops
A-List.
<br><br>
This is a collection of 40 figures listed in no particular order
who will mold the 2023-24 season. We certainly couldn't hit everyone, but
here's our crack at it. Agree or disagree? Tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/CBBONFOX" target="_blank">@CBBONFOX</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/John_Fanta" target="_blank"> @John_Fanta.</a> to let us know what you think.</p>

<h2>Players</h2>

                <h3>1. Zach Edey, Purdue</h3> 
<p>The 7-foot-4, 300-pound center is the face of college basketball. To think
that Edey averaged 22.3 points, 12.9 rebounds and 2.1 blocks per game
while shooting 61% from the field and is still in college basketball is
wild. His return is a total gain for everyone in West Lafayette and casual
followers, and it's a complete nightmare for the rest of the Big Ten.
After sweeping all six major national player of the year honors last
season, Edey's last college goal is clear: avenge last year's shocking
loss to 16-seed Fairleigh Dickinson and charge the program on a deep NCAA
Tournament run. </p>

         <h6>Zach Edey's 2023 Player of the Year Highlights</h6>
    
<h3>2. Hunter Dickinson, Kansas</h3>
<p>If I had told you 10 years ago that a three-time All-Big Ten selection and
a 2021 All-American was still in college after averaging 18.5 points and
9.0 rebounds per game, you may have been a little surprised. Part of that,
of course, is the current age of the NBA, as traditional post players are
less coveted. Hunter Dickinson left Michigan for the transfer portal
instead of the pros, eventually picking Bill Self and the Jayhawks. The
splash addition of Dickinson in Lawrence combined with the returns of
point guard Dajuan Harris, wing Kevin McCullar and forward K.J. Adams, and
the addition of sharpshooter Nick Timberlake, are all reasons Kansas could
very well be the preseason No. 1 team in the country.</p>

<h6>Hunter Dickinson's Michigan Highlights</h6>
<br>
<h3>3. Kyle Filipowski, Duke</h3>
<p>The Blue Devils have an argument to be the No. 1 team in the country
because Jon Scheyer enters his second year as head coach with an
incredible sophomore class highlighted by Filipowski. The 7-footer, who
won ACC Freshman of the Year, was the only first-year player to average at
least 15 points and nine rebounds per game. Many draft experts had the big
man going somewhere around the 15-20 range in the NBA Draft, if not
higher. It's not common for a player of that status to return to school.
With Filipowski and a loaded core, the Blue Devils have a strong chance to
win the program's first national championship since 2015.</p>

<h6>Kyle Filipowski's 2022/23 Season Highlights</h6>
<br>
<h3>4. Armando Bacot, North Carolina</h3>
<p>In the last two seasons, no player has been more important to his team
than Bacot. North Carolina went from being an 8-seed to reaching the
national championship game, then went from being the preseason No. 1 team to missing the Big Dance altogether. Bacot has seen it all, while at
the same time achieving history of his own. It's wild to think Bacot is
already North Carolina's all-time leading rebounder with 1,335 boards and
68 double-doubles.
Can UNC bounce back? That starts with Bacot's leadership.</p>

<h6>Armando Bacot's 2022/23 Season Highlights</h6>
<h3>5. Tyson Walker, Michigan State</h3>
<p>Over the final eight games of Michigan State's 2022-23 season, Walker
averaged 18.6 points and 3.8 assists per game. He powered the Spartans to
the Sweet 16 with his 23-point performance in the win over a Big East
champion Marquette team. In essence, he is the closer for Tom Izzo.
It wouldn't be a surprise to see the Spartans playing in Arizona this
April, as they also return A.J. Hoggard, Jaden Akins and Malik Hall, and
bring in star recruit Xavier Booker.</p>

<br>
<h6>Tyson Walker's 2022/23 Season Highlights</h6>
<h3>6. Tyler Kolek, Marquette</h3>
<p>The reigning Big East Player of the Year is back at Marquette, and the
Golden Eagles have championship expectations again with him at the point
guard spot. All Kolek did last season was tally 270 assists to just 90
turnovers while leading Shaka Smart's team to the conference regular
season and tournament crowns. In the Big East Tournament, he averaged 18.7
points, 7.0 rebounds and 5.0 assists en route to the Most Outstanding
Player honor at Madison Square Garden. The senior point guard fits Smart's
system and program well and plays mistake-free basketball.</p>

<h6>Tyler Kolek drops 29 on Providence</h6>
<br>
<h3>7. Isaiah Collier, USC (and a note on Bronny James)... </h3>
<p>The No. 1 ranked freshman in college basketball is a USC Trojan. It's
going to be fascinating to see just how good Collier, the 6-5 guard,
three-time Georgia Mr. Basketball honoree and Naismith High School Player
of the Year, ends up being in his one-and-done season in Los Angeles. He
joins veteran guard Boogie Ellis in a backcourt that is filled with
options, with one hovering storyline over the Trojans as well: the status
of Bronny James. Will we see the 4-star freshman guard step on the
hardwood in a college basketball game following his cardiac arrest
incident in July? Regardless, Collier will impact this USC team, and it's
an interesting wrinkle that the top freshman in the country doesn't reside
at a blue-blood institution this time around.</p>

<h6>Potential #1 Overall Pick Isaiah Collier high school hoop mixtape</h6>
<br>
<h3>8. Donovan Clingan, UConn</h3>
<p>The pride of Bristol, Connecticut, Clingan is a dream for UConn to have on
its side.
The 7-2 center looks poised to take over as the main option on the
interior after Adama Sanogo held that role on Connecticut's fifth national
title team last season. In just 13 minutes per game, Clingan averaged
seven points and six rebounds. He blocked a shot for right around every
seven minutes he played. He could very well be a contender for Big East
Player of the Year, All-American status and everything in between.</p>

<h6>Donovan Clingan's 2023 championship tournament run highlights</h6>
<br>
<h3>9. Max Abmas, Texas</h3>
<p>His numbers are downright amazing, and he's already made history, having
helped Oral Roberts reach the Sweet 16 for the second time in the school's
history back in 2021. Abmas is the active leading scorer in the country
with 2,562 career points in 4,280 minutes of college basketball. He is a
great get for first-year Texas head coach Rodney Terry, and it's going to
be fascinating to see what the fifth-year guard's final chapter entails in
Austin.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6AnQq9tmhGE?si=qUyuNWit8DpMotWL" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h6>Max Abmas 2022-23 Highlights</h6>
<br>
<h3>10. Terrence Shannon Jr., Illinois</h3>
<p>The Big Ten has two all-conference first-team honorees from last year back
for this season: Edey and Shannon. If Brad Underwood's team is going to be
a consistent top-20 squad it's because of Shannon, who averaged 17.2
points per game last season. Yes, Coleman Hawkins and Dain Dainja will
control the frontcourt and Quincy Guerrier was a nice add, but Illinois
has backcourt questions beyond Shannon. He will have to put this team on
his back.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kx4BJancYY0?si=cVXknFq57OltGcNC" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h6>Terrence Shannon Jr. 2022-23 Highlights</h6>
<br>
<h3>11. Ryan Nembhard, Gonzaga</h3>
<p>Last season, Gonzaga went 31-6 and reached the Elite Eight. As incredible
as Drew Timme was, though, Mark Few just didn't have enough consistency
from Rasir Bolton, Nolan Hickman and the Zags' guards. Enter Nembhard, who
was also in the Elite Eight with Creighton. He's following in the
footsteps of his older brother Andrew, who was the WCC Sixth Man of the
Year during the Zags' national runner-up season in 2020-21. The Zags will
go as far as Nembhard takes them this upcoming year. He averaged 12.1
points, 4.8 assists and 4.0 rebounds per game and could very well be
leading a top-15 team.</p>
<h3>12. Caleb Love, Arizona</h3>
<p>This is the most fascinating transfer storyline of the season. Love, an
All-ACC Honorable Mention selection who ranks eighth all-time in UNC
history with 200 made 3-pointers, essentially had a mutual parting of ways
from Chapel Hill after a disastrous season. He was going to head to
Michigan, but didn't have a sufficient number of credits to transfer from
Chapel Hill.
Two weeks following the Wolverines saga, Love announced he was off to
Arizona to play for Tommy Lloyd. He joins a program that has gone 61-11
over the last two seasons. That being said, he joins a core on the
perimeter that includes Kylan Boswell, Jaden Bradley and Pelle Larsson.
There is competition present for Love. Will he play under control? He's
combined to turn the ball over 277 times in three years of college
basketball. That has to change, and he's relying on Lloyd's coaching and a
change of scenery to help.</p>
<h3>13. Justin Moore, Villanova</h3>
<p>Once he returned to the swing of things after an Achilles injury suffered
the previous year, Moore showed just how much he means to Villanova. The
Wildcats finished the season 7-3 in their final 10 games. Moore averaged
15 points per game, was clutch in key situations and more than anything,
settled Villanova down. Now, the fifth-year guard charges a Villanova team
that is stacked with Eric Dixon, transfers Tyler Burton, TJ Bamba, Hakim
Hart and Lance Ware, along with sophomore point guard Mark Armstrong.</p>
<h3>14. Kerr Kriisa, West Virginia</h3>
<p>What a wild offseason in Morgantown with Bob Huggins' disastrous end to
his Hall of Fame tenure. Interim head coach Josh Eilert gets an
opportunity to run WVU, and he will rely on the Arizona transfer to lead
the Mountaineers backcourt. Kriisa is a veteran guard, having averaged 9.9
points and 5.1 assists per game this past season. The bad news: turnovers.
He totaled 91 giveaways this past season, close to three per game. Can
Kriisa put his best basketball together as a senior and find his mojo in
the Big 12?</p>
<h3>15. Ryan Kalkbrenner, Creighton</h3>
<p>You can't overstate how much the 7-1, 270-pound center means for Greg
McDermott's Bluejays. A two-time Big East Defensive Player of the Year,
Kalkbrenner is an elite rim protector with 199 blocks in his three
seasons. On the offensive end, he averaged 15.9 points and 6.1 rebounds
this past season and is currently sixth in NCAA history with a 67% field
goal percentage. Here's the thing about Creighton: The Jays are always
known for being offensively efficient and having terrific guards.
Kalkbrenner makes them elite defensively.</p>
<h3>16. Tristan Da Silva, Colorado</h3>
<p>Deion Sanders isn't the only superstar in Boulder, as Da Silva is one of
the most skilled players in college basketball. With a 6-9 frame and an
ability to knock down perimeter shots consistently, having made over 39%
of his looks from beyond the arc this past season, Da Silva's return
automatically makes Tad Boyle's team a Pac-12 title contender.</p>
<h3>17. Xavier Johnson, Indiana</h3>
<p>Coming off a broken foot that ended his season this past December, the
Indiana point guard enters his sixth season of college basketball as the
clear leader of Mike Woodson's Hoosiers. With Trayce Jackson-Davis and
Jalen Hood-Schifino gone, Indiana needs Johnson to lead the new-look
backcourt. He should be one of the best in the Big Ten in assists and is
the big certainty for an IU team that has some other questions to answer.</p>
<h3>18. Nijel Pack, Miami</h3>
<p>It feels weird stating this about a team that followed up an Elite Eight
appearance in 2022 with the school's first Final Four appearance in
program history: The Miami Hurricanes are going to be a national contender
yet again, and it doesn't feel like that's getting discussed enough. Pack
is the headliner guard for the Canes. The 6-footer enters his senior year
as a quick, explosive guard who's coming off winning NCAA Midwest Region
Most Outstanding Player after he combined for 41 points in wins over
Houston and Texas en route to the Final Four.</p>
<h3>19. Wade Taylor IV, Texas A&M</h3>
<p>After taking a major sophomore leap with the Aggies this past year and
being named a consensus first-team All-SEC selection, Taylor enters his
junior season as a star guard to lead Buzz Williams' squad in College
Station. Taylor was one of three D-I players with 500-plus points, 125-
plus assists and 50-plus steals while making 85% or better on free throw
attempts.</p>
<h3>20. Zakai Zeigler, Tennessee</h3>
<p>A two-time SEC All-Defensive Team selection, Zeigler fits Rick Barnes'
system incredibly well and is great at making plays for others, having
averaged 5.4 assists with 10.7 points per game this past year. The issue:
the tough, 5-9 guard's status is up in the air as he is working his way
back from an ACL tear suffered last February against Arkansas. If Zeigler
is healthy, he can elevate Tennessee to being an SEC title team and a
Final Four dark horse contender.</p>
<h3>21. Lamont Butler, San Diego State</h3>
<p>He made the buzzer-beater of the college basketball season last year,
lifting the Aztecs to their first-ever national championship game
appearance.
Well, Butler is back and will help lead SDSU's backcourt on a team that
still has three of their top four scorers back from a year ago and added
rising junior guard Reese Dixon-Waters from USC. Look for Butler to be a
double-digit scorer in his senior season and one of the faces that comes
up when next March rolls around for his heroics on college basketball's
biggest stage last April.</p>
<h3>22. Jahmir Young, Maryland</h3>
<p>Young transferred from Charlotte to the Terrapins in 2022 to help head
coach Kevin Willard put Maryland basketball back on the map and taste the
NCAA Tournament. Young not only experienced March Madness, but he helped
guide the Terps to a first-round win over West Virginia. The fifth-year
guard will be one of the best in his conference and has the burst-ability
to get buckets in bunches with nine 20-plus point performances this past
year.</p>

<br>
<h2>Coaches</h2>

<h3>23. Jon Scheyer, Duke</h3>
<p>While reeling in a combined seven five-star recruits in his first two
years at the helm has been impressive, Scheyer stands out even more for
the high-impact returning stars on his roster. After a 27-win season and
an early first-weekend exit in the NCAA Tournament, there's unfinished
business for Jeremy Roach, Tyrese Proctor, Mark Mitchell, Filipowski & Co.
There's a lot in place that would suggest Scheyer could lead the Blue
Devils to a Final Four. We'll see how he handles the critical situations
of the season with a year under his belt now.</p>
<h3>24. Rick Pitino, St. John's</h3>
<p>There was not a more interesting offseason coaching move in the country
than Pitino returning to Madison Square Garden and taking the St. John's
job. Everywhere the 71-year-old Hall of Famer has gone, he's won. That's
what makes this so intriguing, because the Big East-based Red Storm have
been irrelevant for the better part of the last two decades and are
without an NCAA Tournament win since 2000. Pitino has overhauled the
roster with high-impact transfers Jordan Dingle, Chris Ledlum and Daniss
Jenkins, among others. He's elevated the game count at Madison Square
Garden this year to eight contests, the most for the Johnnies since the
2014-15 campaign. Pitino could very well snap that March Madness drought
with a top-25 caliber team.</p>
<h3>25. Eric Musselman, Arkansas</h3>
<p>It's really incredible what the 58-year-old has done in four years with
the Razorbacks. I love this stat: Before 2021, Arkansas had not appeared
in a Sweet 16 since 1996. Musselman has led the program to three
consecutive appearances and two Elite Eight slots in the last three years.
He consistently wins the transfer portal season, and this year was no
different, not to mention Devo Davis and Trevon Brazile are back.</p>
<h3>26. John Calipari, Kentucky</h3>
<p>Calipari has the No. 1 recruiting class in the country with Justin
Edwards, Aaron Bradshaw and DJ Wagner highlighting the group. Bradshaw has
a foot injury that remains concerning, which will be a situation to
monitor. Having veterans Antonio Reeves and Tre Mitchell certainly helps,
but here's the fact of the matter: In a world where being old is what wins
in March, Calipari is still mostly relying on youth. The Wildcats haven't
reached the second weekend of the NCAA Tournament in five seasons. Can Cal
break that drought? The pressure is on.</p>
<h3>27. Bill Self, Kansas</h3>
<p>He's the complete package and will have the No. 1 team in the country
heading into the season. If the Jayhawks can win it all in April, Self
will join Roy Williams, Jim Calhoun, Bob Knight, Adolph Rupp, Mike
Krzyzewski and John Wooden as the only coaches in men's college basketball
history with three or more titles.</p>
<h3>28. Dan Hurley, UConn</h3>
<p>The head coach of the defending national champions has a reloaded Huskies
team with Clingan, Alex Karaban and Tristen Newton back, sharpshooter
transfer Cam Spencer added to the fold, and the nation's No. 5 recruiting
class.</p>
<h3>29. Dusty May, FAU</h3>
<p>What an interesting and refreshing case Dusty May is in college hoops.
From serving under Bob Knight as an undergraduate manager at Indiana, to
13 years as an assistant, to getting his head coaching chance in 2018,
May's journey is remarkable. The fact he kept FAU's Final Four roster
together is extraordinary in the transfer portal age. He and the Owls will
be firmly in the spotlight now, playing one of the best non-conference
slates in the country.</p>
<h3>30. Kyle Neptune, Villanova</h3>
<p>It's a massive Year 2 for Neptune, who struggled in his first season at
the helm of the Wildcats as they missed the NCAA Tournament for the first
time since 2012. There's no shortage of talent. Can he get all the pieces
to come together?</p>
<h3>31. Adrian Autry, Syracuse</h3>
<p>When you search Adrian Autry's name on Google, one of the automated
questions that comes up is: "Will he play zone defense?"
That sums up what it's like to follow Jim Boeheim, whose 47-year run as
Syracuse's head coach ended in March. Autry has said he will go to much
more man-to-man defense and that the Orange will look different under him.
Autry finally gets his chance to show that he can be a head coach in
college hoops, and he has two high-level guards to work with in Judah
Mintz and Notre Dame transfer JJ Starling.</p>
<h3>32. Tom Izzo, Michigan State</h3>
<p>The Hall of Famer has something serious cooking in East Lansing. The
Spartans are coming off a really strong finish, making a 15th appearance
in the Sweet 16 under Izzo. They've got all of their major pieces back and
a top-tier recruiting class. Could Izzo be the one to snap the Big Ten's
title curse? It's certainly possible, and the storybook feels like it
still has another big chapter in store for Izzo.</p>
<h3>33. Matt Painter, Purdue</h3>
<p>He's one of the best coaches in the sport, but nationally, the narratives
don't reflect that right now because of the loss last March to 16-seed
FDU. That's what makes this year the most fascinating of his head coaching
career. How much did he learn from that historic NCAA Tournament defeat?
Can he shut up the critics and lead Edey and the Boilers on a Final Four
run? He'll be under the microscope entering March Madness next year; fair or not.</p>
<h3> 34. Mick Cronin, UCLA</h3>
<p>Cronin has done a great job in Westwood in his four years leading the
Bruins, with three consecutive Sweet 16 appearances and a Final Four run
in 2021, but the 2023-24 season will be his biggest challenge yet as Jaime
Jaquez and Tyger Campbell are gone. Sophomore guard Dylan Andrews, big man
Adem Bona and 7-3 freshman Aday Mara, who is ranked 15th in the 247 Sports
recruiting rankings, will be tasked with keeping things moving.</p>
<h3>35. Scott Drew, Baylor</h3>
<p>There are some unknowns with the Bears heading into this season, but with
the No. 4 recruiting class in the country this season, including highly
touted guard Ja'Kobe Walter, plus transfers RayJ Dennis and Jayden Nunn; not to mention Jonathan Tchamwa-Tchatchoua returning. You can't count out Drew and his Bears.</p>
<h3>36. Mike Woodson, Indiana</h3>
<p>The upcoming season, his third at the helm in Bloomington, will be
Woodson's most challenging. He has his point guard, Johnson, back in the
fold and brought in big men Kel'el Ware from Oregon and highly touted
freshman Mackenzie Mgbakpo. Will the Hoosiers have enough perimeter
shooting?</p>
<h3>37. Hubert Davis, North Carolina</h3>
<p>His first season saw the highest of highs seemingly out of nowhere, as he
led the Tar Heels to the national championship game. His second year
featured the lowest of lows with dysfunction and disappointment. So, Davis
has seen it all in a short period, but he did a nice job bringing in
transfers that I believe will fit in well. If all the pieces connect
correctly, this could be a team that contends at the top of the ACC and is
in the top 20-25.</p>
<h3>38. Kim English, Providence</h3>
<p>He is regarded as one of college basketball's rising stars and takes over
a Providence program that has an expectation to contend in the Big East
and make the NCAA Tournament. He has Bryce Hopkins, a Big East Player of
the Year candidate, as well as Swiss Army knife guard Devin Carter back,
along with a nice set of additions to the roster. We'll see how English
handles the gauntlet of the Big East.</p>
<h3>39. Ed Cooley, Georgetown</h3>
<p>January 27, 2024 will be the wildest atmosphere in college basketball when
Cooley has to return to Providence after being the first coach to leave
one Big East school for another this past March. Cooley was synonymous
with Providence, and Friars followers feel betrayed.
As for Cooley and his new stop, it's been a while since we've talked about
the Hoyas in a positive light because they've been in the darkness for
years. This doesn't look like an NCAA Tournament team this upcoming
season, as size is a concern. But the backcourt carries upside and Cooley
has proven an ability to grind out wins in the Big East. Regardless,
Georgetown is no longer irrelevant.</p>
<h3>40. Kelvin Sampson, Houston</h3>
<p>The Big 12 has already been college basketball's best conference in recent
years. Add in a program that prides itself on toughness and physicality,
and it only adds to the rich competitive nature of the league. It's going
to be fascinating to see how the Cougars, who look like a top-10 team,
fare in their inaugural year in the Big 12. Life without Marcus Sasser
presents challenges, but Sampson made additions with Baylor transfer LJ
Cryer and Temple transfer Damian Dunn to join Jamal Shead in the
backcourt.</p>
