<h1>Congratulations, you get to experience peak</h1>

<p>Joey Chestnut is one of the most dominant athletes in the history of American Sports. He has won 16 Nathan's Famous Annual Hot Dog Eating Titles in 17 years in a streak that is still ongoing. On what is literally and figuratively the biggest stage in the sport, Chestnut takes down dog after dog to defeat competitor after competitor after competitor, and when it is all over, he stands alone. The first line of his Major League Eating bio is "Joey Chestnut is the greatest eater in history. That is not empty editorializing or bloviating. That is empirical fact." On top of all of this, Joey Chestnut means a lot to me personally, as I wrote my college essay on him and I owe my acceptance to the University of Maryland to this absolute legend of sport. </p>
